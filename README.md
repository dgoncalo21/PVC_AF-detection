# PVC_AF-detection
Detection of Premature Ventricular Contractions and Atrial Fibrillation using MATLAB.

Project developed for the "Clinical Informatics and e-health Systems" courses. ECG signals were processed in order to identify R peaks using Pan-Tompkins algorithm and then PVC were classified using the R peak distance and the QRS complex area with a cluster. AF were classified by calculating the derivative between R peaks and establishing a threshold.
